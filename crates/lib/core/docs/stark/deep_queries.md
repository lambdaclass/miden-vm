| Procedure | Description |
| ----------- | ------------- |
| prepare_stack_deep_queries_computation | Prepares the stack for the computation of the DEEP composition polynomial FRI queries.<br /><br />It also performs some pre-computations that are common to all queries as an optimization.<br /><br />Input: [...]<br />Output: [Y, query_ptr, query_end_ptr, W, query_ptr, ...]<br /><br />where:<br /><br />1. `Y` is a garbage word,<br />2. `query_ptr` is a pointer to the memory region from where the query indices will be fetched<br />and to where the computed FRI queries will be stored in a word-aligned manner,<br />3. `query_end_ptr` is a memory pointer used to indicate the end of the memory region used in<br />storing the computed FRI queries,<br />4. `W` is the word `[q_z_0, q_z_1, q_gz_0, q_gz_1]` where `q_z = (q_z_0, q_z_1)` and<br />`q_gz = (q_gz_0, q_gz_1)` represent the constant terms across all FRI queries computations.<br /> |
| compute_deep_query | Compute the DEEP composition polynomial FRI query at `index`.<br /><br />Input: [Y, X, index, query_ptr, query_end_ptr, W, query_ptr, ...]<br />Output: [?, Y, query_ptr+1, query_end_ptr, ...]<br /><br />where:<br />1. `Y` is a garbage word,<br />2. `X` is `[q_x_at_alpha_0, q_x_at_alpha_1, q_x_at_alpha_0, q_x_at_alpha_1]` where<br />`q_x = (q_x_0, q_x_1)` is the variable part of the query,<br />3. `index` is the query index in the FRI domain,<br />4. `query_ptr` is a pointer to the memory region from where the query indices will be fetched<br />and to where the computed FRI queries will be stored in a word-aligned manner,<br />5. `query_end_ptr` is a memory pointer used to indicate the end of the memory region used in<br />storing the computed FRI queries,<br />6. `W` is the word `[q_z_0, q_z_1, q_gz_0, q_gz_1]` where `q_z = (q_z_0, q_z_1)` and<br />`q_gz = (q_gz_0, q_gz_1)` represent the constant terms across all FRI queries computations.<br />7. `?` is a binary flag indicating if there are further queries to process.<br /> |
