//! Lifted Matrix Commitment Scheme (LMCS) for matrices with power-of-two heights.
//!
//! This module provides a Merkle tree commitment scheme for matrices that store
//! polynomial evaluations over multiplicative cosets. The tree is indexed by
//! **domain order** (natural index): callers address leaves by domain index,
//! and bit-reversal concerns are encapsulated inside the LMCS.
//!
//! # Main Types
//!
//! - [`config::LmcsConfig`]: Configuration holding cryptographic primitives (sponge + compression)
//!   with packed types for SIMD parallelization.
//! - [`Lmcs`]: Trait for LMCS configurations, providing type-erased access to commitment
//!   operations.
//! - [`LmcsTree`]: Trait for built LMCS trees, providing opening operations.
//! - `lifted_tree::LiftedMerkleTree`: The underlying Merkle tree data structure.
//! - [`proof::Proof`]: Single-opening proof with rows, optional salt, and authentication path.
//! - [`proof::BatchProof`]: Batch opening data with Merkle witness for path extraction.
//!
//! # Mathematical Foundation
//!
//! Consider a polynomial `f(X)` of degree less than `d`, and let `g` be the coset generator and
//! `K` a subgroup of order `n ≥ d` with primitive root `ω`. The coset evaluations
//! `{f(g·ω^j) : j ∈ [0, n)}` can be stored in two orderings:
//!
//! - **Canonical order**: `[f(g·ω^0), f(g·ω^1), ..., f(g·ω^{n-1})]`
//! - **Bit-reversed order**: `[f(g·ω^{bitrev(0)}), f(g·ω^{bitrev(1)}), ..., f(g·ω^{bitrev(n-1)})]`
//!
//! where `bitrev(i)` is the bit-reversal of index `i` within `log2(n)` bits.
//!
//! # Lifting by Upsampling
//!
//! When we have matrices with different heights n₀ ≤ n₁ ≤ … ≤ nₜ₋₁ (each a power of two),
//! we "lift" smaller matrices to the maximum height N = nₜ₋₁ using **nearest-neighbor
//! upsampling**: each row is repeated contiguously `r = N/n` times.
//!
//! For a matrix of height `n` lifted to `N`, the index map is: `i ↦ floor(i / r) = i >> log2(r)`
//!
//! **Example** (`n=4`, `N=8`):
//! - Original rows: `[row0, row1, row2, row3]`
//! - Upsampled: `[row0, row0, row1, row1, row2, row2, row3, row3]` (blocks of 2)
//!
//! # Why Upsampling Works
//!
//! Given evaluations of `f(X)` over a coset, upsampling to height `N = n · r` (where `r = 2^k`)
//! produces evaluations of the lifted polynomial `f'(X) = f(Xʳ)` over the larger coset.
//!
//! The internal hashing uses matrices whose rows are in bit-reversed order (as produced by
//! `BitReversedMatrixView`). For such data, upsampling by nearest-neighbor repetition
//! (`i >> k`) produces the correct lifted evaluations. The LMCS then bit-reverses the
//! leaf digest array so the Merkle tree is indexed by domain order.
//!
//! # Opening Semantics
//!
//! When opening at domain index `d`, the LMCS maps `d` to bit-reversed row index
//! `bitrev(d) >> k` for each matrix. This returns the same values that were hashed
//! into Merkle leaf `d`.
//!
//! # Equivalence to Cyclic Lifting
//!
//! Upsampling bit-reversed data is equivalent to cyclically repeating canonically-ordered data:
//!
//! ```text
//! Upsample(BitReverse(data)) = BitReverse(Cyclic(data))
//! ```
//!
//! where cyclic repetition tiles the original `n` rows periodically: `[row0, row1, ..., row_{n-1},
//! row0, ...]`.
//!
//! This equivalence follows from the bit-reversal identity: for `r = N/n = 2^k`,
//! `bitrev_N(i) mod n = bitrev_n(i >> k)`.
