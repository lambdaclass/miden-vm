//! Peak prover memory model for the precompile chiplet-stack proof.
//!
//! Mirrors `miden_air::memory`'s peak-memory model for the Miden VM proof, generalized over the
//! [`NUM_CHIPLETS`] heterogeneous chiplet AIRs. [`prover_peak_bytes`] models the allocations that
//! dominate peak usage: each main and aux trace held at its 1x buffer plus its blowup-factor LDE,
//! the quotient accumulator, every layer of the three per-proof LMCS digest trees (main, aux,
//! quotient) alive at `open` time, the transient per-leaf hashing buffer held while whichever of
//! those trees is under construction squeezes its leaf digests, and the process-cached
//! BytePairLut preprocessed bundle. That bundle retains its raw `2^16 × 4` trace, its
//! blowup-factor LDE, its LMCS digest tree, and the same transient per-leaf hashing buffer for
//! its own one-time construction. The estimate covers one proof and the preprocessed bundle for
//! its selected hash configuration. It excludes bundles cached for other hash configurations and
//! concurrent proofs.
//! Smaller or transient allocations — FRI folding layers, the DEEP composition polynomial,
//! per-chiplet scratch buffers, allocator slack, rayon scratch, the live session — are covered
//! instead by [`SAFETY_NUMERATOR`] / [`SAFETY_DENOMINATOR`], a documented guess rather than a
//! measurement.
